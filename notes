to compile with multiple packages each package must be seperate
ex: -package re -package random

it is ok to compile a package with no dependencies with the
packages anyways (this might simplify the compilation process)
CHECK: see if this makes the final exe bigger
ANS: there seems to be no differece from a small test

order of compilation matters, a given files mli file must be
compiled before the ml file. then in the final link if file B
uses something from file A then file A.cmx must come before file
B.cmx in the link command
