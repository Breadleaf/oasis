implement feature for full path resoultion
file a/b.ml should resolve to a/b.ml not b.ml

implement file entry specification
(should work like the python compiler)
ex: python3 main.py will compile main.py as the entry point of the program

implement directory walking to get files from multiple directories
if main.ml relies on ./subdir/lib.ml compiler should figure this out

make a test standard modeled after go
ex: fname_test.ml
